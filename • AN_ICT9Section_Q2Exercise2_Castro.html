  <p>Load up on guns, bring your friends<br>
It's fun to lose and to pretend<br>
She's over bored and self assured<br>
Oh no, I know a dirty word</p>

<p>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello</p>

<p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido<br>
Yeah, hey<br>
Yay</p>

<p>I'm worse at what I do best<br>
And for this gift I feel blessed<br>
Our little group has always been<br>
And always will until the end</p>

<p>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello</p>

<p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido<br>
Yeah, hey
Yay</p>

<p>And I forget just why I taste<br>
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile<br>
I found it hard, was hard to find<br>
Oh well, whatever, never mind</p>

<p>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello</p>

<p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido<br>
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial<br>
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial</p>
